TODO:
- Implement newton raphson method
- build out more detailed jacobian with H, N, M, L blocks (i.e. don't assume voltage magnitude of 1)

Ideas for expanding this power simulation tool
- Make line resistance based on temperature
- Implement unit checking (with pint?)
- check that there are no loops

- visualization tools
- do slack bus calculation behind the scene/optimally pick slack bus
- Look into shunt admittance for buses?
- implement transformers

Topics/questions to dig more into:
Q: Why only model one phase?
A: We model an equivalent per phase circuit
